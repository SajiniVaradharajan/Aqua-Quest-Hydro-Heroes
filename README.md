In "Aqua Quest: Hydro Heroes," players navigate the game by starting with the "Start Game" button, transitioning to the main game interface displaying days remaining, water resources, and points. 

Players can start the music with the “play” button and use action buttons to promote water-saving practices (+50 liters, +10 points), implement water restrictions (-100 liters, +20 points), and fix leaks (+20 liters, +5 points). The help button offers guidance of how to use the game without affecting the game state. 

Every two actions, a motivational quote appears for 10 seconds. The water meter reflects resource changes visually. The game ends when water resources or days reach zero, showing a game over message and a "Next" button which takes the user to a final yet motivational about water conservation.
